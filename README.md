# 1000devs-2022

This repo will contain the work done by me for the #100-Devs program through
Leon Noel of LearnWithLeon on Twitch.tv and will function as a backup,
demo/portfolio, and a teaching tool.

Most, if not all, of the files will remain open for public consumption, usage,
repurposing, etc. without attribution. You are free to use these files as you
wish.

I do not claim to be a professional programmer (yet) and most of my approaches
are likely sub-optimal. I will try to write clean code and comment it well.

If you wish to leave feedback or criticism, use Github's commenting abilities.

Thank you.
